# KwanzaCoin
African made Token built on top of Ethereum blockchain.

## 1. Introduction
KwanzaCoin - Is an 'educational-oriented' token that's aiming towards Africans. Its use is intended for educational purposes only (for now) and as proof of concept. We hope It will change the direction of crypto philanthropy; by becoming more secure, transparent, and ethical. 

KwanzaCoin is introducing “KCC”, a new cryptocurrency (ERC-20 Token) and entire smart contract ecosystem. The ecosystem powered by Ethereum Blockchain will have decentralized apps (dApps) to allow KwanzaCoin to operate seamlessly within them.

Initially the ecosystem will include some of the open source decentralized apps like:

- Farms & Land Auctions Platform
- Loaning Platform like VICOBA
- Local Sponsorship Platform for creatives: Musicians, Artists etc.
- Education Charity & Learning Platform
- and so on...
